After the power of all seven books was unleashed, helping the Board Director 
was no problem at all! Exhausted, you leave the library feeling positive 
about the impending vote tomorrow morning. 

The next morning...

"How does the Board vote? All in favor, say 'aye'."

"Aye."

"Aye."

"Aye!"

A chorus of 'Aye's reverberates around the chamber.

"All against?"

Silence.

"Motion passes unanimously! The library shall remain open indefinitely with
an increase in funding."

Satisfied, you shut off the news channel and go back to your breakfast of 
waffles and strawberries, already wondering about your next library quest.
