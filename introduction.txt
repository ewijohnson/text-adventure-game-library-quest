The low rumble of thunder in the distance echoes towards the library 
as you rush to avoid the inevitable rain. You didn't want to come in
to work today, but after weeks of research, you think you have figured 
out how to save the library from the tough financial spot it's been in.

You have found cryptic mentions of seven Magic Books. Each book must be
found and returned to an unknowing staff member who can release the magic
of each book. When the magic of all seven books has been unleashed, the
library will reach its full power.

If the library reaches its full power by the time the Board Director
visits later this afternoon, he'll have no choice but to keep the library
open when he leads the vote tomorrow morning. If the magic isn't unleashed
by then, unfortunately all bets will be off.
