# Library Quest

Have you ever dreamed of finding magical books to save the library from defunding?
Have you ever wanted to help, confuse, or sneak away from patrons?
Have you ever wanted to collect mystical potions and books hidden in the library?

Then this text adventure RPG game is for you!

Version 1.0 is tentatively finished.

To play, download all files and folders. 
Then run "main.py". 

## Starting Hints
When you start playing you can bring up a menu that will tell you what your available actions are. 

If you don't know what you should do, start by talking to as many people as you can. Some of 
them will give you hints and help you to understand the game and how to perform certain 
actions better. 

### Minor starting hint spoiler:

If you're still lost, just start at the library entrance, and work your way through the library
from there, talking to everyone. You'll find a hint in one of the first locations on the first floor.
